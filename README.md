# MyForumTest
Just relearning laravel. Wouldn't advise using it lol.

Been following the Laracasts "Let's Build a Forum in Laravel" to get back into the swing of things after a two year break.
Wouldn't really advise loading this as it will probably have a few bugs and doesn't have the typeAhead search functionality on it.
